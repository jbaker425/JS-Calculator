# JS-Calculator
Calculator project from theOdinProject.com using HTML, CSS, and Javascript

Runs by clicking on index.html and it will open in your browser.

If running in Firefox you might have to turn off quick find since the '/' key activates it, but it is also used for the divide function for the calculator.
